\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Microcontroller}

A microcontroller is an integrated circuit ( IC), usually via an MPU, memory and certain peripherals, to control other parts of an electronic system .
These devices are optimized for embed-in applications that require agile and agile processing, digital, analog or electromechanical interactions.
\subsection{8051 Microcontroller}
In 1981, Intel introduced an 8-bit microcontroller called the 8051. It was referred as system on a chip because it had 128 bytes of RAM, 4K byte of on-chip ROM,
two timers, one serial port, and 4 ports (8-bit wide), all on a single chip.\\\\
The different features of the 8051 microcontroller include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4KB bytes on-chip program memory (ROM)
    \item 128 bytes on-chip data memory (RAM)
    \item Four register banks
    \item 128 user defined software flags
    \item 8-bit bidirectional data bus
    \item 16-bit unidirectional address bus
    \item 32 general purpose registers each of 8-bit
    \item 16 bit Timers (usually 2, but may have more or less)
    \item Three internal and two external Interrupts
    \item Four 8-bit ports,(short model have two 8-bit ports)
    \item 16-bit program counter and data pointer
    \item 8051 may also have a number of special features such as UARTs, ADC, Op-amp, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{7-Segment LED Display}
A seven segment display module is an electronic device used to display digital numbers and
it is made up of seven LED segments. LEDs are PN-junction diodes which emit energy by a process called electroluminescence.
Because of the small size of the LEDs, it is really easy for a number of them to be connected together to make a unit like seven segment display.
The light energy is emitted as ‘photons’ when it is forward biased by a voltage applied across its junctions.
In a seven segment display module, seven LED s are arranged in a rectangle. Sometimes,
an additional LED is seen in a seven segment display unit which is meant for displaying a decimal point.

Features of seven segment Display:-

\begin{itemize}
    \item Available in two modes Common Cathode (CC) and Common Anode (CA)
    \item Available in many different sizes like 9.14mm,14.20mm,20.40mm,38.10mm,57.0mm and 100mm (Commonly used/available size is 14.20mm)
    \item Available colours: White, Blue, Red, Yellow and Green (Res is commonly used)
    \item Low current operation
    \item Better, brighter and larger display than conventional LCD displays.
    \item Current consumption : 30mA / segment
    \item Peak current : 70mA
\end{itemize}

The displays common pin is generally used to identify which type of 7-segment display it is. As each LED has two connecting pins,
one called the “Anode” and the other called the “Cathode”, there are therefore two types of LED 7-segment display called: Common Cathode (CC) and Common Anode (CA).
The difference between the two displays, as their name suggests,
is that the common cathode has all the cathodes of the 7-segments connected directly together and the common anode has all the anodes of the 7-segments connected together

\end{figure}

\subsection{Applications of Seven Segment Display}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used in applications where font size is required to be bigger
    \item Microcontroller Independent, hence used in small circuit projects
    \item Used in combination with four segments to display measurement/sensor value  with four characters
    \item Has bright illumination, hence used where display are required to work in low light or dark conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timers in 8051}
The basic 8051 has two on-chip timers that can be used for
timing duration or for counting external events. Interval timing
allows the programmer to perform operations at specific
instants in time. Since the microcontroller operates at a specific
frequency, we could work out exactly how much iterations of
the time delay was needed to give us the required delay. Their application could be in communication for  generating  rectangle  pulses,  watchdog  timer,  in  manufacturing industry  for  counting objects,  measuring  intervals,  etc.  There  are  two  different  types  of timer:  Interval  timer  and Counter.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.79,cframe=blue 0.5pt 3pt]{./t0t1.jpg}
    \caption{T0, T1 Timer Register}
\end{figure}

Two timers, namely Timer 0 and Timer 1 are 16 bits timer
and since 8051 has an 8-bit architecture, each 16-bits timer is
accessed as two separate registers of low byte and high byte.
The low byte register is called TL0/TL1 and the high byte
register is called TH0/TH1.

\subsection{Timer Mode Register(TMOD)}
TMOD is a 8-bit register whose lower 4 bits are for Timer 0 and upper
4 bits are for Timer 1.
It  is  byte  addressable  only,  which  is loaded  at  the  very beginning  of  a  program  to  initialize  a  timer's  mode.
In each case, the lower 2 bits are used to
set the timer mode and upper 2 bits to specify the operation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Timer Mode 0}
          Mode  0is identical  for  Timer  0  and  Timer  1.  Both  timers  work  as  13-bit counters;an  interrupt is generated  when  counter  overflows.  It  takes  8192  input  pulses  to  generate  the  next interrupt. Timers  use  8-bits  of  THi  and  5  lower  bits  of  TLi.  After  timer  overflows  TFi(Timer flag  in TCON) is set, hence an interrupt occurs.

    \item \textbf{Timer Mode 1}
          This mode is similar to mode 0. This timer uses all 8 bits of THi and 8 bits of TLi. So it is a 16-bit counter which can take 65536 input pulses to generate the next interrupt.

    \item \textbf{Timer Mode 2}
          In  this  mode,  the  timers  are  8  bits  auto  reload  type.  The  timer  is  operated by  TLi, when TLi overflows again it is automatically loaded by THi. So the initial value is loaded to the THi register at first.

    \item \textbf{Timer Mode 3}
          In this mode, only timer 0 can be used. This is also called split timer mode. Timer 0 operates  TL0  and  TH0  as  two  separate  8  bit  timers/counters.  Timer  0with  TL0  is  operated with TF0 and TR0 while timer 0 with TH0 is operated with TF1and TR1.

\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.89,cframe=blue 0.5pt 3pt]{./Timer mode.jpg}
    \caption{Timer mode control register}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Timer Control Register (TCON)}
The 8051 microcontroller has one 8-bit register that holds the timer flags, interrupt ags and timer run control bit. This register is bit addressable and is used by both timers as well as interrupts. The timers use the upper4-bits while interrupts use the lower 4-bits.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.89,cframe=blue 0.5pt 3pt]{TCON.jpg}
    \caption{Timer Control Register (TCON)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Clock Sources for Timer}
\textbf Using  TMOD  register,  timer operation  is  selected,  and timer  is clocked from an oscillator. Frequency for timer is $1/12^{th}$ the frequency of the crystal attached to the 8051 microcontroller, which is equivalent to 921.6 KHz (frequency of an oscillator is 11.0592  MHz).  This  is  so  as  in8051  microcontroller,  12  oscillator  periods constitute  a machine cycle. Hence machine cycle period is 1.085 microseconds.

we have made a delay of 3 ms and used it for both on and off cycle. For off cycle, delay is looped four times as off time is four times of on time.
