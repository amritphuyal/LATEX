\section{Title} {\large To Introduce the Concept of Subnetting, Subnet Mask, VLSM and CIDR}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To be familiar with subnetting, subnet mask and its use
    \item To be familiar with VLSM and CIDR

\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network simulation tool: Packet Tracer
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Procedure}

With the help of Cisco Packet Tracer we simulated Subnetting of  different IP ranges also explored  VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) and  CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
We performed Ping Operation to visualize the concept of Subnet and prove that to communicate between different network Router is required.

\subsubsection{Activities A}

{\bfseries \textit{A. Create the network topology as shown in figure 1 below, and note down the output by performing the following activities:}}

\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{ Assign the IP address of PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4 as 202.22.22.11, 202.22.22.21,
              202.22.22.41, 202.22.22.81 respectively with subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and note down
              the result of following operations:}

              \caption{Assign IP address and subnet mask for PC1}
          \end{figure}



    \item \textbf{ Test the connectivity from one computer to all another computers using ping.}

          \CMD{./CODES/A2P4-3.txt}{Ping from PC4 to PC3}

          Since subnet mask is (/24) it covers usable host from 202.22.22.0 - 202.22.22.254 in a single network so ping is possible between and among the PCs with the help of switching device only.


    \item \textbf{ Change the subnet mask to 255.255.255.192 and test the connectivity from one computer
              to all another computers using ping.}

          \end{figure}


          With subnet mask (/26)  PC1, PC1 and PC3 falls under same subnet  and PC4 under different subnet so ping failed to and from PC4 but successful among PC1, PC2, PC3.


    \item \textbf{ Change the subnet mask to 255.255.255.224 and test the connectivity from one computer
              to all another computers using ping.}

          \end{figure}

          With subnet (/27) only PC1 and PC2 falls under a same subnet and ping is possible between them  but as PC3 and PC4 falls under different subnet ping failed to and from (PC1, PC2) , PC3 and  PC4.


    \item \textbf{ Change the subnet mask to 255.255.255.240 and test the connectivity from one computer
              to all another computers using ping.}

\subsubsection{Activities B}

{\bfseries \textit{B. For the situation given in 5 of activity A above, replace the central switch i.e. switch0 by a router and configure its interfaces with appropriate IP address and subnet mask. Also configure each computer with default gateway. Test the connectivity from one computer to all another computers using ping.}}

In the Activity A.5 we illustrate that all PCs falls under different subnet and as we know Router is needed to communicate between different network. Here in this activity we used Router  between the PCs of different Network  which makes the Ping Successful from any PCS to any other PCs.

          With subnet mask (/23) PC1 and PC2 falls under one subnet similarly PC3 and PC4 falls under different subnet. So ping is possible between between PC1 and PC2 and similarly between PC3 and PC4 but ping failed between different subnet.

\begin{Q}
    {
        Explain subnetting and VLSM with their importance in networking with suitable examples.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        Subnetting is the technique to prevent formation of complex large network and instead divide that network and create fast, efficient and secure network and routes.
        There are two subnetting techniques  (VLSM) variable Length Subnet Mask and (FLSM) fixed length. In FLSM all subnet has equal host and uses same subnet mask wasting lot of IP whereas  VLSM  Subnet has variable host and uses different subnet mask with reduced ip wastage.

        Some importance of subnetting are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Divides the broadcast domain improving the network performance
            \item The data intended for host within the same subnet will not leave the subnet thus reducing the congestion and improving security.
            \item It also helps to organize the complex network into subnets based on departments and location.
        \end{itemize}




        In the example below IOE was given 202.70.90.0/24  ranges of IPs.Without subnetting the whole IOE network become complex and unsecure as  Student and Department are under same subnet (/24) but after the VLSM subnetting is done  as Student has need of 120 host and Department has need of 50 host only so they are divided into two subnets using subnet mask (/25) and (/26) respectively.  There is still unused IP range from 202.70.90.192 - 202.70.90.255 which wil be beneficial for further expansion of departments and future use.

\begin{Q}
    {
        What is classless routing? Why is it used in Internet system? Explain with suitable
        examples.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        In Classful Routing subnet mask are not sent with updates instead the default Subnet mask for particular class based on IP is used. But in Classless Routing Subnet mask are also sent along with IP. Classless Routing Supports VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) is supported and also CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).\\

        As we know :
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Class B with a mask of 255.255.0.0 can support 65, 534 addresses
            \item Class C with a mask of 255.255.255.0 can support 254 addresses
        \end{itemize}

        But if there is need of 600  or 5000  host just Class C will be insufficient and Class B will waste large no of IPs. However if Classless routing is implemented with VLSM it will prevent ip wastage and network collision.

\section{Conclusion}


In this lab we familiarize ourselves with Subnetting , VLSM ,CIDR and Subnet mask. In Activity A we created the subnet with the help of subnet mask and try to communicate between different subnet as switch as medium but failed However, In Activity B when  central switch is replaced by Router Ping is successful. Similarly we explored the concept of subnet in Activity C even further . In Activity D we created 7 subnet of Equal host  and configured the static route between the router . Similarly in Activity E VLSM technique is used.
