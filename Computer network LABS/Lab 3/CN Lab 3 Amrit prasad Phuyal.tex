\section{Title} {\large Basic Configuration of a Router}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
      \item To be familiar with Network Simulation Tool: Packet Tracer
      \item To be familiar with router, and its different components
      \item To be familiar with commands for basic configuration of a router
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Network simulation tool: Packet Tracer
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Procedure}
This do-along Lab session Includes Introduction to Routers its Functions and different components used in Routers . We used CISCO packet tracer software to simulate the setup of router ,switches and some PCs and their connection. We performed the Basic Configuration of Router using terminal and different commands , Changed hostname , set password and virtual terminal and used telnet.

\begin{Q}
      {
            What is a router? Explain its role in computer networks.
      }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
      {
            Routers are networking device capable of receiving analyzing and forwarding data packets among the connected computers.At Router the arrived packets are inspected to determine destination address and then with the help of routing table shortest/best route is determined and packets are forwarded .

            \end{figure}
            Routers are Network layers device having basic functionality of exchanging data packets among the networks.The network can be both  Local area or Wide area Network.The received IP packets are forwarded towards their destination using routing Tables , which is updated frequently through communication between routers. Other important roles of router are Load balancing, Firewall,packet filtering etc..

            List out the basic configuration commands of router (that you have used in this lab) with their syntax and functions.\\
      }
\end{Q}
\begin{itemize}
      \item To move to Privileged EXEC mode from User EXEC mode \textbf{enable} is used  and to return back \textbf{disable} is used.
            \CMD{user interface modes.txt}{Router user interface modes}

      \item To configure Router Hostname  first we have to be at Privileged EXEC mode followed by \textbf{configure terminal} command and then following codes are executed and required hostname : AMRIT is set.
            \CMD{Hostname.txt}{Configuring Hostname}
      \item To configure ethernet interface, Privileged EXEC mode is used one of the important command is \textbf{ip address (ip) (subnet)}. All other codes and syntaxes are mentioned below:

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Activity D.1}

            First of all router is configured through terminal and all other PCs are configured with the help of IP configuration Option.For left  Switches GigabitEthernet 0/0 port is used and configured to \textbf{200.10.8.1} and for right GigabitEthernet 0/1 is used and configured to \textbf{200.10.9.1}. In all PCs the given ip are assigned with subnet mask \textbf{255.255.255.0} and default gateway \textbf{0.0.0.0}(default)

Default gateway is the Hardware node that facilitate the connection betweens and among the networks. Previously  the default gateway for device connected to left switch was \textbf{0.0.0.0} though it is physically connected to GigabitEthernet 0/0 port of Router having assigned ip \textbf{200.10.8.1} and similarly for right side the default gateway was \textbf{0.0.0.0} though it is physically connected to GigabitEthernet 0/1 port of Router having assigned ip \textbf{200.10.9.1}\\

Due to this  problem PC0 can Ping PC1 But Unable to ping router or any devices on right sides (PC2,PC3), as without proper Default Gateway PC0 has  no idea how it can connect to a totally different network at right hand side .\\

BUT after changes to Default gateway was made  all PCs can Ping each other and  Router.


\section{Conclusion}
Lab exercises includes Basic Configuration, Changing Hostname ,Ping and Information about importance of Default gateway(Router) in Network . While pinging PC3 fom PC0 with Default Gateway \textbf{0.0.0.0} there was error as Packets cant reach the destination because the sender PC0 has wrong information about Path to be followed to reach PC3. Soon after the Default Gateway was corrected all PCs and Router can Ping Each other. The Packet tracer file is attached with this report.
