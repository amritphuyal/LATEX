\section{Title} {\large Configuration of Dynamic Routing using RIP and OSPF}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To be familiar with dynamic routing
    \item To configure dynamic routing using RIP and OSPF
    \item To observe how the dynamic routing can address changing network topology automatically
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network simulation tool: Packet Tracer
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Procedure}

With the help of Cisco Packet Tracer we simulated Subnetting of different IP ranges also explored
Configuration of Dynamic Routing using RIP and OSPF. We performed  ping and trace route between different PCs and compare result before and after performing RIP and OSPF dynamic routing.

\begin{Q}
    {
        What is a dynamic routing? How it differs with static routing? Explain briefly.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        Dynamic Routing is an Adaptive type routing which adjust its Routing Table according to change in Network Topology.It is less secure and uses Protocols like BGP , RIP, OSPF.

        Static Routing is manually defined for every router and every network whereas Dynamic routing adapts the change and propagate the changes to neighboring router. Static routing use simple algorithm whereas Dynamic has complex algorithm. Static Routing is suitable for small network and doesnot required additional resources But Dyanamic Routing is suitable for bigger network and additional resources is required.

          We can clearly see that there is additional entries in Routing Table in all routers with initial \textbf{R} than available in Activities A.5.  Although we have only configured RIP for connected interface the routing table includes all others routes through communication between the router. In Router 0 we have only entered the neighboring details in Rip but its Routing Table has Routing Path to Network 4.

{\bfseries \textit{B. To increase the reliability, add a new router to connect Switch0 with Switch1 as shown in
        figure below. Assign IP address to both interfaces of router as specified. Configure RIP in this

First Disable Passive interface for Network 1 and Network 4 in order to receive updates in Router 4.

\CMD{./CODES/BR4IPR.txt}{Assigning Ip and Configuring RIP Router 4}


\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Observe the output of show ip route command in each router, and compare with that of
              previous case that is specified in Activity A.}

          \CMD{./CODES/B_Showip4R.txt}{\textit{show ip route} Router 4}


          After enabling RIP on additional Router (Router 4) the Routing table in each router has been updated to reach its destination with minimum hops or through shortest path. For example in Router 0, previously there was entry to reach Network 4 through 202.60.1.0 network taking 3 hops but now it has been updated through 200.60.0.10 in 1 hop.


    \item \textbf{Use tracert command from each PC to each another PC and note down the result. Note how
              the changing network topology is addressed by dynamic routing automatically.}

          \CMD{./CODES/BT3-0.txt}{Trace Route from PC3 to PC0}

          With RIP and Shortest path algorithm Router now has data or routes to reach destination through shortest routes. Taking PC0 and PC3 as example, Before introducing Router 4 between Network 1 and 4 , Packets from PC0 has to travel through Router 1 then Router 2 then Router 3 and finally to PC3 But now Packets can reach to PC3 in 1 hops through Router 4.



    \item \textbf{Now disconnect the link between Router0 and Router1 and observe the output while using
              tracert command from each PC to each another PC. Note how changing network topology
              is addressed in dynamic routing. Also observe the routing table of each router using show
              ip route.}

          \CMD{./CODES/B_Showip4D1.txt}{\textit{show ip route} Router 4}

          Through \textit{tracert} output of PCs and Routing Table of routers , it is clear that Router has Successfully adapted to change in topology hence determine shortest and alternative Router to destination. For example, Previously Packets from PC4 used to travel  through 202.60.1.0 to Router 0 and then to PC0 but as that link is down Router has determined the alternative path theough Router 2 then Router 3 then Router 4 and finally to PC0.


    \item \textbf{Similarly observe the routing table of each router and output of traceroute/tracert command
              by removing different links between routers as well as by connecting the links.}

          \CMD{./CODES/B_Showip4D3.txt}{\textit{show ip route} Router 4}

          Here PC1 uses the Routes through PC4 to reach PC2 after link to connect these Network is disconnected.

    \item \textbf{Note down how the changing network topology is addressed by dynamic routing protocol
              automatically to determine the optimal path to reach each of the destination network.}

          Through RIP protocol, Routing information is periodically shared between the routers so, when any changes is detected, it first update its routing table then send updates to neighbors about changes and its available neighbors.

          With addition of Router 4 there is noticeable changes in Routing Tables in all Routers.
          From above Trace route and Routing table of Router 3 one can explain how OSPF adapts to changes and determine the shortest path to destination.


    \item \textbf{Remove a link i.e. the link between router 4 and switch 0 and then observe the result of
              traceroute command from PC3 to PC0 and routing table in each router. Compare the result
              of previous. Note down how the routing is updated to address the changing topology.}

\begin{Q}
    {
        How dynamic routing can address the changing topology of a network automatically?
        Explain with reference to the observation of your lab exercise.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        Dynamic Routing is Adaptive routing technique. Here in this LAb we explore RIp and OSPF . In dynamic Routing, Routers shares the routing Information to its Neighbors and neighbor updates its routing table if any shortest path to any network is found.

        RIP uses distance vector algorithm where as OSPF Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest path to destination.

\section{Conclusion}

In this Lab we familiarize ourselves with dynamic Routing and its protocols like RIP and OSPF.
In Activity A we created the setup and Configured RIP and tested with the help of Ping and Tracert command. In Activity B we connected additional router and studied the changes it makes to the routing tables. We also observe the output after disconnecting different links and how Network reacts and stay connected during that time. Activity C and D are based on OSPF with additional touch of VLSM .
