\section{Title} {\large VLAN Configuration, Forwarding Packets within VLAN and Routing
  packets between VLANs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To be familiar with VLAN and its use
    \item To create VLANs and deliver packets between computers that are within the same VLAN
    \item To route packets between computers at different VLANs
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Requirement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Network simulation tool: Packet Tracer
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Procedure}

With the help of Cisco Packet Tracer we simulated VLANs. we also explored the packet forwarding within VLAN and Routing them between VLANs.

\begin{Q}
    {
        What is VLAN? Explain its importance in networking.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        VLAN (Virtual LAN) divides broadcast domain in devices like Switch. In other terms its a technique to create a sub network of devices situated physically on different LANs.

        The needs of VLAN in networking are as follows :
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Improve security as it limits access  to devices and users.
            \item Improved manageability as it has feature to group devices and user with similar requirement or function
            \item Reduces overall IT cost as it eliminated the need of actual physical hardware and wires.
        \end{itemize}
    }

\begin{Q}
    {
        How VLAN can be configured? Explain each step in detail.
    }
\end{Q}


VLAN can be Configures in two steps :

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Creating VLANs}
          \begin{verbatim}
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# vlan vlan_ID
Switch(config-vlan)# name Vlan_2
Switch(config-vlan)# end
Switch#  \end{verbatim}
    \item  \textbf{Assigning an Interface to Particular Vlan}
          \begin{verbatim}
 Switch> enable 
 Switch# configure terminal
 Switch(config)#interface FastEthernet0/11
 Switch(config-if)#switchport access vlan 2
 Switch(config-if)#end
 Switch#  \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\begin{Q}
    {
        How packets can be forwarded between computers within same VLAN but connected at
        different switches? Explain.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        Concept Trunk can be implemented if two devices on same VLAN but different Switches has to communicate. In trunk mode Trunking protocols include VLAN information in each frame transmitting through it.The receiving end forwards the packets to destination after deframing the VLAN info. This has been implemented and tested starting from \textbf{Activity B.1} .\\

        Another Simpler method is to simply add extra interface corresponding to particular VLAN .This has been implemented and tested in \textbf{Activity A.7}
    }

\begin{Q}
    {
        How packets can be routed between computers at different VLANs? Explain.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        An Router can provide a viable solution to our problem as its primary task is to route the packets between different network or sub network like VLAN.Router can be connected in two ways . One is to separately connects interfaces connecting belonging to VLANs and other is to use trunk and sub interface technique to achieve similar functionality using single interface. These are Implemented in \textbf{Activity C and D}\\

        Another Simpler method is to introduce $3^{rd}$ Switch that simply connects the interfaces belonging to different VLAN.For this to work they must belong to same subnet.This has been implemented and tested in \textbf{Activity B.6}
    }
