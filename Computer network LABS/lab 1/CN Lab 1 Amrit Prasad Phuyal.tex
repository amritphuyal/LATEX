\section {Procedure}
As explained in Lab sheet provided we need layering in order to create modular environment in network so that change 
to any particular module doesn't affect other modules. TCP/IP module combine presentation, 
session layer of OSI in to application layer and similarly data link and physical layer to Networks access layer.
There are different addressing in Different layers like MAC ,IP, Port address used by different devices  like Router 
, Bridge, Switch, Repeater/Hub.\\

Like wise there are different category of UTP cable  from CAT1 to CAT6 and more 
having different Data rate therefore different Application.
Either T568A or T568B  Standard has to be followed before crimping UTP cable inside RJ45 Connector. Furthermore,
Connection can be either Straight-through( follows same orientation) or crossover cable ( 1 and 2 pins of one end connected to 3 and 6 pins of other).\\\\

Different Model of Lan Cable Tester are available in the market . the model we used in the lab was battery powered 
and has two detachable module. One of them with switch and bulky was Transmitter where as other was Receiver.
It has  9 led lights in each module ( 8 pins of Rj45 port and Ground) and switch to initiate the  testing.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6,cframe=blue 0.5pt 3pt]{lantester.jpg} 
    \caption{LAN Cable Tester}
\end{figure}

For testing the LAN cable following steps has to  be followed:-
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make sure both Ends are connected to their respective module(TX and RX). 
    We have to release the Wire only after hearing the clicking sound on RJ45 port.
    \item Note whether all 8 pins(led) light up , since we haven't connected any ground GND remains off.
     If the LEDs light up in order then Cable is alright and functioning and the connection is Single through.
    if not in order then there might be error during connection or the connection is Crossover.
\end{enumerate}

In one of the wire provided in the LAB  had mismatched connection so we corrected and
 tested it using  Crimping tool and LAN tester. The crimping tool provided can do multitask like can strip jacket of wire using Stripper,
 can cut wire in equal length through cutter , crimping wire to Rj45 connector using crimper and many more.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7,cframe=blue 0.5pt 3pt]{crimper-tool.png}
    \caption{Cable Crimping Tool}
\end{figure}

Following steps were followed in order to repair that faulty connection:-

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  One end of the wire was inserted to  stripping section then squeezed and rotated  which only cuts jacket and peels it off.
    \item Then the wires were straighten and arranged in order and then cut evenly, leaving only about 13mm of wire hanging.
    \item Tip of each wires were cut and copper was exposed , then inserted into the Rj45 connector such that the jacket also has space inside the connector.
    \item It was them crimped using Crimping section of Crimping tool and tested further using LAN tester.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Q}
{
    What is layered network architecture? Why layering is important?
}
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
        Network Architecture can be termed as framework that direct the design and its functionality. 
        In layered network architecture the complex Network Architecture is divided into sequence of layer 
        and each assigned with particular task.Here Particular layer only interact with layer above and below it only after following protocols.
         for example:- In OSI model architecture there are 7 layers  namely :- 
        Application, Presentation, Session, Transport,Network, Data link and Physical layer.

        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering

            \caption{Layered OSI Architecture}
        \end{figure}

        In Network Architecture layering is important due to following reason:-
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Using layering complex network problems can be divided in to smaller manageable tasks.
            \item It provides the Modularity Features. Each layer is independent which makes easier to implement and maintain.
            Thus providing greater  flexibility.
            \item Being the modular Design , the no. of equipment or protocol in particular layer can be altered as per the need.
            \item Being each layer independent , multiple vendors can provide support and develop the hardware .
        \end{itemize}

    {
        What is protocol? List out ten different standard protocols having at least one in each layer of TCP/IP
        reference model.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
Protocols are set of rules that need to be followed by electronics devices to format data, to transmit and receive data.
Protocols includes Data format and commands to communicate.\\

Different Protocols used in TCP/IP layers are:- 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Application:} NFS, NIS+, DNS, telnet, ftp, rlogin, rsh, rcp, RIP, RDISC, SNMP,HTTP, SMTP and others
    \item \textbf{Transport:} TCP, UDP

\begin{Q}
    {
        Why logical addressing is required in network communication? Explain briefly.
    }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
    {
In networking there are two types of addressing  Logical and Physical.
Physical addressing useS manufacture assigned MAC address for identity where as 
Logical addressing uses virtual assigned  IP address.\\

The main reason for using Logical address instead of MAC is to forward the traffic effectively across the globe.
Manufacture assign consecutive product, the consecutive MAC address but those product may end on the opposite side of the globe.
So, when Mac is used the data packet has to travel back and forth around the globe until it reaches the destination.
In order to solve this issue Logical addressing is in use. It is assigned to a device as per their Location(ISP). so, the data packet 
intended for that device can first travel to ISP then to the device easily.

\section{Conclusion}
This lab started with introduction to Computer network and devices involved in different layers,
like switch ,hub ,Routers and then we move to different cables and connectors and all the way to cable tester and  Rj45 cable with Crimping tool.
In this lab we also got familiar with  Straight through  and crossover cable connection and their practical uses.
