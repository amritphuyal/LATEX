\section{Procedure}

We created three different networks and explore different networking terms like Subnet, Subnet mask, Default gateway, Routing, Static Routing, Routing table, etc. we also learned the technique to extract network id of destination  network if subnet mask is known.We Configured each interface of each routers. We also explored the telnet through different router and configure it .We performed Numerous Ping operation to confirm the connectivity betweens and among networks and subnets and repeated the Ping operation after configuring the Static route. We also observed the Routing table to confirm the static routing. We have compared the result of previous similar operation/ping with current .

\begin{Q}
      {
            What is a subnet mask? Why is it used? Explain with examples.
      }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
      {
      Subnet is a technique to split larger network in to smaller ones like partitioning the whole floor into rooms .If one have to communicate with other on same subnet/Room then  there is no need of Router/doors reducing traffic congestion , unnecessary routes and network speed.

      Subnet mask hides(mask) host id from IP address and is 4 bytes long having similar format to IP address. i.e

      \begin{center}
            \textbf{0-255 . 0-255 . 0-255 . 0-255}
      \end{center}

      Host use subnet mask to determine whether the destination is within the subnet or outside. Subnet mask also serve the purpose of limiting or defining the range of valid ip for specific network.\\

      Lets examine how subnet mask divides network and host id/address from an IP address.
      lets take Class C IP address \textbf{192.168.123.132} and default Class C subnet mask \textbf{255.255.255.0}. here Network id is determined by AND operation of Subnet mask and IP address and remaining part of Ip address is Host id.

      \HRule\\

      {\bfseries

      11000000.10101000.01111011.10000100 -- IP address (192.168.123.132)

      11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 -- Subnet mask (255.255.255.0)\\


      \textit{ANDing gives Network address and remaning is Host address.\\}


      11000000.10101000.01111011.00000000 -- Network address (192.168.123.0)

      00000000.00000000.00000000.10000100 -- Host address (000.000.000.132)}

\begin{Q}
      {
            How does a sending host know whether the destination computer is on the same network or on the different network? How data packet is forwarded in each case from the sending host? Explain.
      }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
      {
            The Host perform the And operation of it's subnet mask and its IP and then with destination IP and extract and match the network address if matched then it falls on same network if not different.If destination is Local then  host determine the MAC(hardware address) using ARP table and forward the packet to destination directly . If destination is remote then Packet is forwarded to default gateway or Router which then handles the remaining  process by consulting the Routing table to determine the best route to destination.

\begin{Q}
      {
            What is a routing? Explain static routing and configuration of static routing in a router with its syntax and functions. Also mention how the routing table of a router can be observed.
      }
\end{Q}

\begin{A}
      {
            A Router is a networking device capable of Handling incoming data packets and forwards to their respective destination network after consulting routing table.
            Routing is technique of selecting the best route for data packets to destination.

            Static Routing is the Non adaptive and manual way of adding routes in Routing table of the Router.Here the routes are fixed by administrator abd unaffected by any changes in network topology.It is easy to configure , Secure and less resource consuming.However it is not suitable for large network and one need to have sound knowledge of topology to configure static routing.


            The basic syntax for static routing Configuration is :
            \begin{center}
                  {\bfseries \textit {ip route}  \quad Destination-Network \quad  Subnet-Mask   \quad   [next-hop-address or outgoing interface]}
            \end{center}

            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Destination Network: Destination Network address
                  \item Subnet-mask: only needed if subnetting is implemented and used tto reveal the destination network address.
                  \item Next-hop-address or outgoing interface: Its an Ip of nearest Router in Routing Path or alternatively we can also specify the interface.

                        There are other parameters like administrative distance and Permanent.
            \end{itemize}
      }
      The Routing Table of router can be observed using command {\bfseries \textit{show ip route} }

            In \textbf{A.2} PC0 could ping all the computers from PC0 to PC6 but now it is unable to ping Network 2 i.e PC3,PC4,PC5  due to Change in Subnet mask. Previously the default subnet mask \textbf{255.255.255.0} due to which Both network 1 and 2 has Network address as \textbf{200.200.20.0} and acts as single network and can forwards packets within the networks freely. But when subnet mask is changed to \textbf{255.255.255.224} the network splits into subnet and network address for Network 1 becomes \textbf{200.200.20.0} and for Network 2 it is \textbf{200.200.20.32}.  So they became the different network and as we know we need Router and Routing Routes to properly exchange package between networks.

            The process to obtain Network address is explained in Exercise 1 and the detailed process of obtaining Network Id for both Network is explained in Activities C.11

            Since default gateway is set to \textbf{0.0.0.0} all outgoing package is forwarded to unknown address which never reach the destination.

      \item \textbf{From PC0 enter into Router0 using telnet and configure the static route for destination network of  Network 3.}

            For Static \textit{ip route} command is used and syntax is:
            \begin{center}
                  {\bfseries \textit {ip route}  \quad Destination-Network \quad  Subnet-Mask   \quad   [next-hop-address or outgoing interface]}
            \end{center}

            We are aware of Subnet mask  and next-hop-address but unknown to Destination-network. which we have to calculate by ANDing the IP address's of network and assigned subnet mask for that network. For Network 3 assigned IPs are 200.200.20.100, 200.200.20.101 and  200.200.20.102 so by ANDing any of these IP with Subnet mask \textbf{255.255.255.224} we get Destination-network.

            \HRule\\
            {\bfseries 11001000.11001000.00010100.011 00101 -- IP address (200.200.20.101)\\
            11111111.11111111.11111111.111 00000 -- Subnet mask (255.255.255.224)\\


            \textit{ANDing gives Network address .\\}


            11001000.11001000.00010100.011 00000 -- Network address (200.200.20.96)\\}

            \HRule\\

            Net hop address is the address of closet router in routing path to travel from router 0 to router 1 next hop address is \textbf{200.200.20.66}. So the syntax will be :

            Without existing from telnet we further telnet to Router 1 to configure Static Route for network 1 and 2. The Destination address for network 1 is calculated as :

            %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%network 1
            \HRule\\
            {\bfseries 11001000.11001000.00010100.000 00011 -- IP address (200.200.20.3)\\
            11111111.11111111.11111111.111 00000 -- Subnet mask (255.255.255.224)\\


            \textit{ANDing gives Network address.\\}


            11001000.11001000.00010100.000 00000 -- Network address (200.200.20.0)\\}

            \HRule\\


            %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%network 2
            Similarly,The Destination address for network 2 is calculated as :\\
            \HRule\\
            {\bfseries  11001000.11001000.00010100.001 00011 -- IP address (200.200.20.35)\\
            11111111.11111111.11111111.111 00000 -- Subnet mask (255.255.255.224)\\


            \textit{ANDing gives Network address .\\}


            11001000.11001000.00010100.001 00000 -- Network address (200.200.20.32)\\}
            \HRule\\


            Thus destination address for Network 1 is \textbf{200.200.20.0} and for network 2 is \textbf{200.200.20.32}. The next hop address for both network is same i.e. \textbf{200.200.20.65}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this Lab we familiarize ourselves with network, subnet and subnet mask, Default gateway and configuration, Routing , static routing and its configuration. We completed this Lab with the help of Cisco packet tracer . We acquire very important skill to extract the Network id from the IP address with the help of Subnet mask. We configured each PCs for Ip, default gateway and  Subnet mask and each interface of Routers for IP and Subnet mask. To check connectivity between and among subnets we perform Ping and compare result in different configuration like before and after configuring Default gateway , before and after configuring  subnet mask and finally before and  after configuring Static Routes in each Router.
